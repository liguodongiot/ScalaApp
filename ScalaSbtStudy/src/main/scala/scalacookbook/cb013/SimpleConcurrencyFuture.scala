  //The code also shows a time duration of 1 second.
  //This is made available by the scala.concurrent.duration._ import.

  //With this library, you can state time durations in several convenient ways,
  // such as 100 nanos, 500 millis, 5 seconds, 1 minute,
  // 1 hour, and 3 days. You can also create a duration as
  // Duration(100, MILLISECONDS),Duration(200, "millis").



  //As mentioned, blocking is bad;
  // you shouldnâ€™t write code like this unless you have to.
  // the following examples show better approaches.
